# 🎉 **Search Functionality FINALLY Fixed with Streamlit-Native Approach!**

## 🚨 **Root Cause of the Problem:**

The console errors revealed the **fundamental issue**:
- **Streamlit doesn't support raw HTML with JavaScript event handlers** (`oninput`, `onfocus`, `onblur`, `onclick`)
- When you use `st.markdown()` with HTML that has these attributes, **Streamlit tries to process them as React events and fails**
- This caused the **"Minified React error #231"** errors you were seeing
- The JavaScript functions were never actually connected to the HTML elements

## ✅ **The Solution:**

### **Replaced Raw HTML with Streamlit-Native Components**
- **Removed all problematic HTML** with JavaScript event handlers
- **Used `st.text_input()`** for proper Streamlit integration
- **Used `st.button()`** for suggestion selection
- **Maintained the beautiful CSS styling** with `st.markdown()` for containers only

### **How It Works Now:**
```python
# Start location input with Streamlit-native autocomplete
start_new = st.text_input(
    "Start location", 
    value=start_value,
    key="start_query_input",
    placeholder="Start location",
    help="Type to search for locations"
)

# Handle input changes and show suggestions
if start_new != start_value:
    st.session_state["start_query"] = start_new
    if len(start_new) >= 2:
        suggestions = photon_autocomplete(start_new, limit=5)
        st.session_state["start_suggestions"] = suggestions

# Show suggestions as clickable buttons
if st.session_state.get("start_suggestions"):
    for i, suggestion in enumerate(st.session_state["start_suggestions"]):
        if st.button(f"📍 {suggestion['label']}", key=f"start_sugg_{i}"):
            _select_point("start", suggestion["label"], suggestion["lat"], suggestion["lon"])
            st.rerun()
```
