# ðŸš€ QUICK START: Neural Network in One Command

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You Get**

I've built a complete TinyGrad neural network alternative that:
- âœ… **Trains on simulated traffic data**
- âœ… **Switches your app automatically**
- âœ… **Maintains the same API**
- âœ… **Works with your existing code**

## ðŸš€ **ONE COMMAND TO RUN IT ALL**

```bash
python run_neural_network.py
```

That's it! This script will:
1. Train a neural network on 200 traffic scenarios
2. Switch your app to use AI instead of fixed rules
3. Test everything works
4. Show you how to use it

## ðŸ§ª **Test It Works First**

```bash
python simple_test.py
```

This trains and tests the neural network without changing your app.

## ðŸŽ® **Run Your App with AI**

After running the setup:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your app now uses the neural network for traffic predictions!

## ðŸ”„ **Switch Between Models**

```bash
# Check current model
python switch_model.py check

# Switch to neural network
python switch_model.py neural

# Switch back to Bayesian
python switch_model.py bayesian
```

## ðŸ“Š **What the Neural Network Learned**

- **Weather effects**: Rain, storm, snow increase delays
- **Time patterns**: Rush hour = more traffic
- **Road problems**: Accidents, construction cause delays
- **Police activity**: High activity = slight delays
- **Driving history**: Aggressive driving = minor delays

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Predictions**

```python
# Clear day, weekend, no traffic
multiplier = 1.0  # Normal speed

# Rainy rush hour, weekday
multiplier = 1.4  # 40% slower

# Storm with accident, evening peak
multiplier = 2.1  # More than double time
```

## ðŸš¨ **If Something Goes Wrong**

1. **TinyGrad not installed**: `pip install tinygrad`
2. **Model not working**: Run `python simple_test.py` first
3. **App not switching**: Check `python switch_model.py check`

## ðŸŽ‰ **You're Done!**

- âœ… Neural network trained
- âœ… App switched to AI
- âœ… Everything tested
- âœ… Ready to use!

**Your traffic prediction app now uses AI instead of fixed rules! ðŸ§ ðŸš¦**
